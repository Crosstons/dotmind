as the project is still a work in progress it has it's limitation so here are the guidelines for prompts - 

> whenever you want to add a new address to the address book make sure that the address is in single inverted commas.

> never use a direct address for transfer or scheduled transfer, make sure that you use a Alias that has been registered in the address book

> all transactions will be signed with an Alias "default" in the private keys file as for now

> please include decimal zeros while entering a transfer prompt for now

> start a scheduled transfer instruction with 'timed transfer - ....'
